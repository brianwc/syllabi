'''Office Hours:''' Mondays 10:00-11:00 & 12:30-1:30 and by appointment

'''Course Websites:'''

* [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~bcarver/ http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~bcarver/] (Main Site)
* [http://bspace.berkeley.edu/ http://bspace.berkeley.edu] (Slides or handouts used in class)

'''Grade and Attendance:'''

* Final Paper: 50%
* Wikipedia Project: 20%
* Participation: 20%
* Brian's Wiki Project: 10%

Each student will be required to write a paper, due at the end of the term, of approximately 20-35 pages, on a topic related to those covered during the semester. Each student will also be required to submit an outline of their proposed final paper at least one month prior to the paper due date. The outline will not be separately graded . See schedule below for exact due dates.<br>

I encourage you to discuss paper ideas with me. You may also gain some insight into choosing an appropriate topic or how to approach a seminar paper from the following:<br>
* Pam Samuelson, ''[http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/%7Epam/papers/goodwriting.html Good Legal Writing: of Orwell and Window Panes]'', 46 Univ. of Pittsburgh L. Rev. 149 (1984).<br>

* Eugene Volokh, Extract from ''[http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/writing/aextract.pdf Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review]'', Foundation Press (2007).<br>

Each student will also, alone or in a small group, identify a topic/case/statute/etc related to those covered during the semester and will edit or create its respective Wikipedia entry so as to improve Wikipedia's coverage of Cyberlaw topics. Topic proposals and, for group projects, an explanation of each group member's responsibilities will be submitted and approved in advance. This assignment will be due at approximately mid-term. See schedule below for exact due dates. Each student will also sign up to review and edit the Wikipedia page edited by a fellow student.<br>

Additionally, students will contribute news articles, legal opinions, or scholarly articles related to the course topics to Brian's Wiki. Students should average at least one substantive contribution per week.

While participation from all students is encouraged in each class meeting, half of the class (last names A-L or M-Z) will be "on call" and bear primary responsibility for moving the discussion forward in each class meeting. Attendance is expected. If you need to miss all or a portion of a class, I will assume you have a good reason, so you need not detail it for me. If you like, you can simply send me an email letting me know you need to miss, but it is not necessary.<br>

'''Textbook:''' Lemley, Menell, Merges, & Samuelson, Software and Internet Law ("SAIL") (3d ed. 2006); additional readings available online. (This textbook is also used for INFO 237 IP Law for the Information Industries, to be offered Fall 2010).

'''Prerequisites:''' None; Students from all levels (graduate/undergraduate) and schools on campus are welcome. However, this is a graduate-level course, so interested undergraduates are encouraged to meet with me before enrolling (or before the drop deadline).

'''Course Description (from the Course Catalog):''' The emergence of global digital networks, such as the Internet, and digital technologies that enhance human abilities to access, store, manipulate, and transmit vast amounts of information has brought with it a host of new legal issues that lawyers preparing to practice in the 21st century will need to understand and address. Although many are trying to "map" existing legal concepts onto problems arising in cyberspace, it is becoming increasingly evident that this strategy sometimes doesn't work. In some cases, it is necessary to go back to first principles to understand how to accomplish the purposes of existing law in digital networked environments. The course will explore specific problems in applying law to cyberspace in areas such as intellectual property, privacy, content control, and the bounds of jurisdiction. Students with familiarity with the Internet and its resources or with backgrounds in some of the substantive fields explored in this course are especially welcome, but there are no formal prerequisites. Grades for the course will be based either on a series of short papers or on a supervised term paper.

'''Course Goals:''' We will survey internet and technology law. Students will, for the most part, be introduced to these topics through reading of judicial opinions, law review articles, in-class lectures, and discussions. Students will illustrate their understanding of the material through discussions, writing assignments, and the final paper.

'''Add/Drop Policy:''' The university determines the last day to drop without a "W". Check with the Registrar.

'''Academic Honesty:''' U.C. Berkeley's Code of Student Conduct prohibits all forms of academic misconduct including but not limited to cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, or facilitating academic dishonesty. See Policy 102.01 at [http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/ucpolicies/aos/uc100.html http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/ucpolicies/aos/uc100.html] and [http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conductiii-vii.asp#V http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conductiii-vii.asp#V] It is my policy to pursue the discipline of such misconduct, including, but not limited to, the entering of a grade of F in the course and a notation (or equivalent) on the student's transcript of the reason for same.

'''Resources:''' [http://dictionary.law.com/ http://dictionary.law.com/] Judges and professors use a lot of legal jargon. Here's a way to look it up.

'''Students with disabilities:''' Students with disabilities who may need accommodations for any sort of disability are invited to make an appointment to see me.

'''Special Thanks:''' to those who previously taught this course, Jason Schultz, Aaron Perzanowski, Fred von Lohmann, and Pamela Samuelson, upon whose work this syllabus is based.

'''SCHEDULE:'''

Note: This is a cross-listed course. Unfortunately, the Law School's Academic Calendar does not align with the Academic Calendar of main campus. Law instruction begins Mon. Jan. 11, but instruction begins on main campus on Tues. Jan. 19. Law instruction ends Tues. Apr. 27, but instruction ends on main campus on Fri. May 7. We will address this by having those enrolled in LAW 276.1 meet on Mon. Jan. 11 and Wed. Jan. 13, while those enrolled in INFO 235 will not meet on those days. Those in INFO 235 will meet on Mon. May 3 and Wed. May 5, while those enrolled in LAW 276.1 will not meet on those days. We will cover the same material in those two sessions, so all students will cover the same material, just at different times.
