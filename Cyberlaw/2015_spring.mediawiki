'''Grade and Attendance:'''

* Final Paper: 45%
* Wikipedia Project (40% total)
** Initial Article(s) (15%)
** First Peer Review (10%)
** Second Peer Review (15%)
* Participation: 15%


Each student will be required to write a paper, due at the end of the term, of approximately 20-35 pages (5,000-8,750 words), on a topic related to those covered during the semester. Each student will also be required to submit an outline of their proposed final paper at least one month prior to the paper due date. The outline will not be separately graded . See schedule below for exact due dates. Everyone should ensure that their paper's format conforms to that described in the Paper Template handout.

Note: JD students (but not LLM students) must write a paper that exceeds 7500 words or 30 pages. This enables the course to receive the "Seminar" designation under the Law School's [http://www.law.berkeley.edu/184.htm Grading Rules and Policies] which then enables me to award a greater number of HH or H grades than would be permitted under the usual grading rules and policies. Law Students that wish to use this paper for their Writing Requirement must meet additional deadlines that are merely "suggested" for others and which are detailed on the "Paper Schedule" handout.<br>

In recent years an increasing number of law students enrolled in LAW 276.1 have begun requesting to delay completing the requirements for this course, particularly the paper, requesting that they be assigned an IP or "In Progress" grade. I will not assign "IP" grades in this course without confirmation from the Registrar that an unexpected medical or similar situation made completing this course's work on schedule impossible. Even in such cases, the IP grade must be resolved by June 30, 2015.

I encourage you to discuss paper ideas with me. You may also gain some insight into choosing an appropriate topic or how to approach a seminar paper from the following:<br>
* Pam Samuelson, ''[http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/%7Epam/papers/goodwriting.html Good Legal Writing: of Orwell and Window Panes]'', 46 Univ. of Pittsburgh L. Rev. 149 (1984).<br>
* Heather Meeker, ''[http://www.aucegypt.edu/academics/dept/law/Documents/Stalking_the_Golden_Topic_H_Meeker.pdf Stalking the Golden Topic: A Guide to Locating and Selecting Topics for Legal Research Papers]'', 1996 Utah L. Rev. 917 (1996).<br>
* Eugene Volokh, Extract from ''[http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/writing/aextract.pdf Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review]'', Foundation Press (2007).
News articles, legal opinions, and scholarly articles related to the course topics can also be found on [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~bcarver/ Brian's Wiki]. Students may find ideas for paper topics or relevant resources on Brian's Wiki.<br>

Each student will also, alone or in a small group, identify a topic/case/statute/etc. related to those covered during the semester and will edit or create its respective Wikipedia entry so as to improve Wikipedia's coverage of Cyberlaw topics. Topic proposals and, for group projects, an explanation of each group member's responsibilities will be submitted and approved in advance. See schedule below for exact due dates. Each student will also sign up to review and edit the Wikipedia pages edited by two fellow students.<br>

While participation from all students is encouraged in each class meeting, 6-8 students will be "on call" each session and bear primary responsibility for moving the discussion forward in each class meeting. Attendance is expected. If you need to miss all or a portion of a class, I will assume you have a good reason, so you need not detail it for me. If you like, you can simply send me an email letting me know you need to miss, but it is not necessary.<br>

'''Textbook:''' Lemley, Menell, Merges, Samuelson, & Carver, ''Software and Internet Law'' ("SAIL") (4th ed. 2011); additional readings available online. (This textbook is also used for INFO 237 IP Law for the Information Industries, typically offered each Fall.)

'''Prerequisites:''' None; Students from all levels (graduate/undergraduate) and schools on campus are welcome. However, this is a graduate-level course, so interested undergraduates are encouraged to meet with me before enrolling (or before the drop deadline). Undergraduates must meet additional paper deadlines that are merely "suggested" for others and which are detailed on the "Paper Schedule" handout.

'''Course Description (from the Course Catalog):''' The emergence of global digital networks, such as the Internet, and digital technologies that enhance human abilities to access, store, manipulate, and transmit vast amounts of information has brought with it a host of new legal issues that lawyers preparing to practice in the 21st century will need to understand and address. Although many are trying to "map" existing legal concepts onto problems arising in cyberspace, it is becoming increasingly evident that this strategy sometimes doesn't work. In some cases, it is necessary to go back to first principles to understand how to accomplish the purposes of existing law in digital networked environments. The course will explore specific problems in applying law to cyberspace in areas such as intellectual property, privacy, content control, and the bounds of jurisdiction. Students with familiarity with the Internet and its resources or with backgrounds in some of the substantive fields explored in this course are especially welcome, but there are no formal prerequisites. Grades for the course will be based either on a series of short papers or on a supervised term paper.

'''Course Goals:''' We will survey internet and technology law. Students will, for the most part, be introduced to these topics through reading of judicial opinions, law review articles, in-class lectures, and discussions. Students will illustrate their understanding of the material through discussions, writing assignments, and the final paper.

'''Add/Drop Policy:''' The university determines the last day to drop without a "W". Check with the Registrar.

'''Academic Honesty:''' U.C. Berkeley's Code of Student Conduct prohibits all forms of academic misconduct including but not limited to cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, or facilitating academic dishonesty. See Policy 102.01 at [http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/ucpolicies/aos/uc100.html http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/ucpolicies/aos/uc100.html] and [http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conductiii-vii.asp#V http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conductiii-vii.asp#V] It is my policy to pursue the discipline of such misconduct, including, but not limited to, the entering of a grade of F in the course and a notation (or equivalent) on the student's transcript of the reason for same.

'''Resources:''' [http://dictionary.law.com/ http://dictionary.law.com/] Judges and professors use a lot of legal jargon. Here's a way to look it up.

'''Students with disabilities:''' Students with disabilities who may need accommodations for any sort of disability are invited to make an appointment to see me.

'''Special Thanks:''' to those who previously taught this course, Jason Schultz, Aaron Perzanowski, Fred von Lohmann, and Pamela Samuelson, upon whose work this syllabus is based.

'''SCHEDULE:'''

Note: This is a cross-listed course. Unfortunately, the Law School's Academic Calendar does not align with the Academic Calendar of main campus. Law instruction begins Monday January 12th, but instruction begins on main campus on Tuesday, January 20th. Law instruction ends on Tuesday April 28th, but main campus instruction ends Friday, May 8th. This problem of calendar mis-alignment has existed for several years.

We will address this by having everyone enrolled in LAW 276.1 attend a first class meeting on Thursday, January 15th, and everyone enrolled in INFO 235 a final session on Thursday, April 30th. We will discuss the same material in these two sessions, just at different times. I also welcome LAW 276.1 students to attend the final regularly-scheduled meeting time with the INFO 235 students (for those who do not have conflicting exams).
